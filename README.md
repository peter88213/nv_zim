# nv_zim

## Features

- Adds an **Open project wiki** entry to the *novelibre* **Tools** menu.
- Selecting the menu entry opens the corresponding *Zim* project wiki, if existing. 
  Otherwise, a new project wiki can be created. 
- Adds **Wiki page** link buttons to the book/characters/locations/items/ properties.
- Clicking on a link button opens the corresponding *Zim* wiki page, if existing. 
  Otherwise, a new wiki page can be created. 
- Newly created wiki pages contain descriptions and other meta data. 
  *novelibre* tags are adopted, so they are a powerful navigation aid in the wiki.

## Requirements

- [novelibre](https://github.com/peter88213/novelibre/) version 5.0+

## Download and install

### Default: Executable Python zip archive

Download the latest release [nv_zim_v0.7.1.pyzw](https://github.com/peter88213/nv_zim/raw/main/dist/nv_zim_v0.7.1.pyzw)

#### Important

Many web browsers recognize the download as an executable file and offer to open it immediately. 
This starts the installation.

However, depending on your security settings, your browser may 
initially  refuse  to download the executable file. 
In this case, your confirmation or an additional action is required. 
If this is not possible, you have the option of downloading 
the zip file. 


### Alternative: Zip file

The package is also available in zip format: [nv_zim_v0.7.1.zip](https://github.com/peter88213/nv_zim/raw/main/dist/nv_zim_v0.7.1.zip)
